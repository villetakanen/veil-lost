      <h1>The Long Night</h1>
      <p>Aeons ago, we looked at the darkness, and something looked back.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="block">
      <h1>A world full of horrors</h1>
      <p>Looking from a Window the world looks as always. People are walking to a bar, snow falls slowly from the sky. Inside, you know everything is different. You have become one of the Lost. Survivors of the Long Dark.</p>
      <p>There is a Voice living inside you called <i>the Nightmare</i>
        or Painajainen. It beckons you to set it free. Let go of your
        soul. Become one of the Fallen. Free yourself from the pain.
        <p>All that would be a curse, if it would not be a blessing of
          sorts too. The Nightmare is a creature of the VEIL, able to
          distort the reality around us. And you can use its powers as
          your own, for a price. For eventually, you will succumb to
          the Nightmare, or embrace the Long Dark.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h1>The vigilant</h1>
        <p>With the powers of the Nightmare you have become one of the
          protectors of this world. A kind of a dark angel watching over
          the mankind.
        </p>
        <p>You are not alone though. There is a handful of others like
          you, and a whole bunch of Others who think they are the one's
          doing the watching and you the one being watched.
        </p>
        <p>Luckily there's a pact between your kind and their kind called
          The Treaty. It states that those who know have to protect the
          sleepers from the reality and respect each others territory.
          Apparently that all started with the atomic age. The weapons
          just got too big for bickering against each other, as there's
          the real enemy too. So the Others let you be as long as you
          let them to their own device's.
        </p>
        <p>There's a catch though. Using the Nightmares powers in public is s beach of the
          Treaty. Which brings us to the bitch Sparkies call the Voice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h1>Enter the Nightmare</h1>
        <p>The official theory of the nature of the Voice calls it the Nightmare. Supposedly the thing is some sort of psychic parasite or a symbiont attached to your soul. While not able to communicate directly with anyone as long as you are in control,  it can use some of its powers to send portents and emotions to you and it does have some sort of a telepathic link between other Nightmares and the Fallen.
        </p>
        <p>You might have noticed the being in control part above. Thats the catch. While the powers of the Nightmare are awfully handy they are not free. Every time you loan power from the Nightmare, it gets a chance to take the reins for a time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h1>The Four and a Half Houses of Long Night</h1>
        <p>So, as you know, there are the Sparks. The sparks are one of small clans or mafia families of our kind: the Four Houses of the Long Night. Or more properly, one of the five (The last one is not really a house, if you ask the first four).
        </p>
        <p>The Four and Half Houses in order of eminence, are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Nocturnals:</b> the first house of the Exodus. Old fashioned creeps, who’s Nightmares can controll the very fabric of night itself.
          </li>
          <li><b>Spectrals:</b> the second house of the Exodus. Eastern type mafia house, who’s Nightmares can manipulate the material world.
          </li>
          <li><b>Haunters:</b> the third house of the Exodus. Capitalistic meddlers, who’s Nightmares can enter peoples heads.
          </li>
          <li><b>Sparkies:</b> the first house of Enlightenment. Recent upstarts, who’s Nightmares have a weird affinity with the technological realm
            <li><b>Obscurae: </b>the halfth house of Long Night. A collection of misfits among the misfits - who take in all those who do not fall under the other houses.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>All the houses have a sort of a leader or a presentative, called Nightmare Legate. These Legates form a court, that interprets the Treaty for our kind. Thats the highest authority for you from now on. Kinda. For the legends tell of those who have ascended our curse, the Witches of the Wild. And the Nightmare Court of the Legates do answer to the Withces if you read their ledger.
          </p>
            <p>(the size of the organization might sound large, as there must be less than 100 of us in the world, but we are old and proud of our ways. Or atleast the Nocturnals are)
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
              <h1>The Fallen</h1>
              If there would be a sixth house of the Long Night, it’d be the Fallen. The wolflike predators, who have given in to the Nightmare. They call themselves free. We see them as monsters enslaved by their desires.
              Most of the fallen live permanently in the VEIL. Sometimes they enter the real world for unknown reasons. Most of the times we drive them back. It’s a bit like cold war yankees and commies in the third world.
              One more point: The Fallen are not protected by the Treaty. So shoot to kill.
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h1>The Damned</h1>
              Real reason we are not openly fighting the Fallen are the Damned. Nothing unites like a common enemy.
              The Damned are followers of Sydänyö, a dark god of the VEIL who wants to eat the world or something like that. Anyway Sydänyö is a nasty creep.
              The Nocturnals have a fable of the creation of our kind before the historical age, that holds them reposible for creation of Sydänyö and our curse. Sometimes fables like that have a seed of truth in them.
