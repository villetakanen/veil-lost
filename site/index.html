        <p>Aeons ago, we looked at the darkness, and something looked back.</p>

      <div class="block">
      <h1>A world full of horrors</h1>
        <p>Looking from a Window the world looks as always. People are walking to a bar, snow falls slowly from the sky. Inside, you know everything is different. You have become one of the Lost. Survivors of the Long Dark.
        <p>There is a Voice living inside you called the Nightmare or Painajainen. It beckons you to set it free. Let go of your soul. Become one of the Fallen. Free yourself from the pain.
        <p>All that would be a curse, if it would not be a blessing of sorts too. The Nightmare is a creature of the VEIL, able to distort the reality around us. And you can use its powers as your own, for a price. For eventually, you will succumb to the Nightmare, or embrace the Long Dark.
